The Manifesto for an Ethical and Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence it's an open document
in the aim of partecipation we added only the points we though were important for us, now 
we want you people to expand and add to this document to make a shared and colloaborative document.

To know what it's already in place read the European act on AI https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/
so you can add or remove what is really needed from The Manifesto.
