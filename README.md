The Manifesto for an Ethical and Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence it's an open document
in the aim of partecipation we added only the points we though were important for us, now 
we want you people to expand and add to this document to make a shared and colloaborative document.

To know what it's already in place read the European act on AI https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/
so you can add or remove what is really needed from The Manifesto.

Supplement: Implementing Ethical AI Principles in Practice
To complement the values and visions expressed in the manifesto, the following actions are proposed to operationalize ethical AI principles:

1. Clear Definitions and Terminology
Develop a shared glossary of key concepts (e.g., AI, data sovereignty, ethics) across communities, researchers, and policymakers to ensure clarity and inclusiveness.

2. AI Explainability and Interpretability
Mandate that AI systems used in critical contexts include explainability-by-design features, enabling users to understand how decisions are made and to contest or override them when necessary.

3. Robust Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
Introduce community-centered risk assessments before deployment. Use open frameworks (e.g., ALTAI – Assessment List for Trustworthy AI) to identify potential harms, especially to marginalized groups.

4. Accountability Mechanisms
Establish independent auditing bodies and community oversight boards to monitor AI systems. Ensure clear legal pathways for individuals and groups to seek redress and hold developers accountable.

5. AI Lifecycle Oversight
Require transparent documentation and review at each phase of AI development — from design and data collection to training, deployment, and post-deployment monitoring. Incorporate public-interest oversight at all stages.

6. Human-AI Interaction and Autonomy
Design AI interfaces that preserve user agency, including opt-out options, clear disclosures, and mechanisms for human intervention in high-stakes decisions (e.g., healthcare, employment).

7. Informed Consent
Implement meaningful, clear, and accessible consent protocols. Ensure users understand what data is being collected, for what purpose, and have the ability to revoke consent at any time.

8. Bias in Training Data and Models
Make training data and model architectures subject to public scrutiny. Promote the use of representative datasets and adopt fairness-aware modeling techniques to reduce bias and discrimination.

9. Ethical Use of Generative AI
Ban the use of generative AI in high-risk applications (e.g., political manipulation, biometric surveillance) without strict oversight. Require transparent labeling of AI-generated content in media, art, and communication.

10. Cybersecurity and System Integrity
Enforce rigorous security standards for all AI systems. Subject systems to third-party audits to detect vulnerabilities, prevent adversarial attacks, and safeguard user data.

11. Collaboration with Industry and Governments
Develop multi-stakeholder governance frameworks that include not only developers and regulators but also civil society, affected communities, and labor representatives to ensure democratic participation in tech governance.

12. Regulatory Frameworks
Support enforceable national and international regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, OECD principles), and create complementary grassroots-led charters or codes of ethics to extend accountability where laws fall short.

These additions aim to bridge the manifesto’s visionary ethics with real-world mechanisms — ensuring that AI systems reflect our collective values and responsibilities, and serve people and the planet over power and profit.
